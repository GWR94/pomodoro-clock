# Pomodoro Clock

Pomodoro Technique, also known as the tomato timer technique or just 25 minute timer technique refers to a popular time management hack that breaks your work time into blocks of 25 minutes for maximum focus and productivity, allowing 5 minutes breaks in between sessions.

This app allows you to set your "Work" timer (defaults to 25 minutes) and a "Break" timer (defaults to 5 minutes) that is the length of break you can reward yourself with after completing the work.

## Usage

Set the length of time you wish to work for within the "Minutes to Work" timer, which can be changed using the arrow buttons. You also need to set up the "Minutes on Break" timer to determine how long your break should be after completing the work timer.

Once both of these parameters have been set, you can click the green play button to begin the timer(s). The timers can be stopped by clicking the red stop button.

Once the work timer has been completed, an alarm will sound to signal that it's time for a break. The break timer will then begin, and once its concluded it will play a different alarm to signal that it's time to work again!
